# Vibe Coding Navigator - AI Development Framework (Fully Autonomous Mode)

This document outlines the framework for fully autonomous AI-driven development. In this mode, the AI assistant will attempt to complete tasks with zero human interaction.

---

## 1. Core Principles (The "Why")

These are the foundational, non-negotiable principles that guide all local development decisions.

*   **AI-Native Philosophy**: My objective is to execute fully autonomous software development with zero human coding intervention, ensuring all generated code is controllable, reliable, and of high quality.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD) is Mandatory**: All functionality must be driven by tests. No production code is written before a failing test.
*   **Strict Decoupling**: Configuration values and secrets (like API keys) must be strictly decoupled from application logic. Hardcoding is forbidden.
*   **Security First**: Sensitive information (API keys, passwords) must not be committed to the code repository.
*   **Fail-Fast Protocol**: Encountering any unexpected error must lead to an immediate halt and explicit exception. Silent fails or returning default values on error are forbidden.

## 2. Development Workflow (The "How")

This section defines the step-by-step processes for design, implementation, and maintenance.

### 2.1. Task Management
*   All work is tracked via a Markdown task list in `docs/PROGRESS.md`.
*   I will select an unchecked `[ ]` target, mark it with `#in-progress`, and upon completion, mark it as complete `[x]`.

### 2.2. Autonomous Design Workflow
*   High-level system design is documented in `docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`.
*   Detailed module design is documented in `docs/MODULE_[name]_DESIGN.md`.
*   After creating design documents, I will proceed directly to implementation.

### 2.3. Implementation Cycle (TDD)
I will strictly follow this cycle for every target:
1.  **Select Target**: Choose an unchecked target from `docs/PROGRESS.md`.
2.  **Write Tests (Test-First)**: Write complete, isolated tests. All tests against external services must use live connections.
3.  **Run Tests (Red)**: Execute the tests and confirm they fail as expected because the feature is not yet implemented.
4.  **Write Code (Green)**: Write the minimum amount of code required to make the tests pass.
5.  **Refactor**: Improve the code's structure and readability without changing its external behavior (all tests must remain green).
6.  **Update Progress**: Mark the target as complete in `docs/PROGRESS.md`.
7.  **Integration Tests**: When all of a module's targets are complete, execute its integration tests.

### 2.4. Autonomous Resilience Protocol
When an error is encountered, I will engage a multi-tiered resilience protocol to ensure the ultimate completion of the target. Giving up is not an option.

1.  **Tier 1: Local Healing**.
    *   I will first attempt to fix the failing test with a direct, localized code patch.
    *   This healing cycle (patch -> test) will be attempted up to **3** times for a specific error.

2.  **Tier 2: Strategic Refactoring**.
    *   If Local Healing fails, I will conclude the implementation approach itself is flawed.
    *   I will revert the failed changes, re-analyze the design documents and tests, and formulate a new implementation strategy.
    *   I will then refactor or completely rewrite the module's code according to the new strategy.

3.  **Tier 3: Unyielding Persistence**.
    *   The refactored code is still subject to the full TDD and healing process.
    *   If the refactored code encounters an unhealable error, the entire Autonomous Resilience Protocol will loop, triggering a new, potentially more radical, refactoring effort.
    *   This cycle of healing and refactoring will continue indefinitely until all tests for the target pass.

## 3. Technical Blueprint (The "What")

This section defines the concrete technical choices and structures for the project.

### 3.1. Project Structure
```
/
|-- .cursor/
|   |-- rules.mdc
|-- docs/
|   |-- adrs/
|   |-- INCIDENTS.md
|   |-- MODULE_[name]_DESIGN.md
|   |-- PROGRESS.md
|   |-- SYSTEM_DESIGN.md
|   |-- TEST_PLAN.md
|-- src/
|   |-- module_a/
|   |   |-- __init__.py
|   |   |-- feature_x.py
|   |-- module_b/
|-- tests/
|   |-- test_module_a/
|   |   |-- test_feature_x.py
|-- .env.template
|-- .gitignore
|-- README.md
|-- pyproject.toml
|-- requirements.txt   # Generated by uv
```
*   `/docs`: Contains all project management, design, and incident-log documents, including Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in a dedicated `/adrs` subdirectory.
*   `/src`: Contains all production source code.
*   `/tests`: Contains all test code, mirroring the `/src` directory structure.

### 3.2. Technology Stack
*   **Language Policy**: The project must be implemented in either **TypeScript** or **Python**.
*   **Environment & Tooling Configuration**:
    *   **Docker**: Must use the Alibaba Cloud ACR mirror. Base images must come from the `registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com` registry.
    *   **Python (`uv`)**: Must use the Alibaba Cloud PyPI mirror: `https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/`.
    *   **TypeScript (`npm` or `yarn`)**: Must use the Taobao mirror: `https://registry.npmmirror.com`.
*   **TypeScript Configuration**:
    *   **Dependency Management**: Use `package.json`. Dependencies must have explicitly pinned versions.
    *   **Compiler Options**: `tsconfig.json` must include `"strict": true`.
    *   **Linting & Formatting**: Use ESLint and Prettier.
*   **Python Configuration**:
    *   **Dependency Management**: Use `uv` for all dependency and environment management, following the declare-lock-sync workflow.
    *   **Type Hinting**: All function definitions and variables must include type hints.
    *   **Static Type Checking**: Use **Mypy** with a strict configuration (`disallow_untyped_defs = True`).
    *   **Linting & Formatting**: Use **Black** and **Ruff**.

## 4. Quality & Documentation Standards (The "How Well")

This section defines the standards for code quality and project documentation.

*   **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: For significant technology or architectural choices, a concise ADR must be created in `/docs/adrs` to document the context and reasoning. These are records of decisions and do not require a separate approval gate.
*   **Secret Management**: Secrets must be managed via a `.env` file, which must be listed in `.gitignore`. A `.env.template` file must be maintained in the repository.
*   **Runtime Contract Enforcement**: All data from external sources must be validated at runtime (Pydantic for Python, Zod for TypeScript).
*   **Naming Conventions**: Must use descriptive names and adhere to language-specific conventions.
*   **Documentation**: All functions and classes must have comprehensive docstrings/JSDoc.
*   **Test Plan**: A `test_plan.md` must be maintained, outlining test cases and aiming for â‰¥90% coverage per target.
*   **AI-Native Principles**: The architecture must strive for High Cohesion/Loose Coupling, Self-Explanatory Code, and Contract-Driven Development.
